## Thanks for checking out my profile!

  - I'm using this Github profile to arrange all the hardware&|software projects I do outside of school
  - For the higher-level of abstraction, I'm most savvy in Python, but also know some Java and C++.
  - As of now, the only Hardware Description Language I know is SystemVerilog.
  - Computer engineering interests me in its marriage of both microarchitecture and architecture concepts

I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!
